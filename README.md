## 🧠 About This Project

I built this Movie Library App to challenge myself to work with APIs and display large sets of dynamic data in a structured way.

I wanted to move beyond simple UI projects and create something that feels like a real application something users can interact with meaningfully.

This project helped me improve how I structure code when handling search queries, API responses and dynamic content rendering.



## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice working with movie APIs
- Handle search functionality dynamically
- Render multiple data cards efficiently
- Improve UI organization and responsiveness
- Learn how to manage local storage



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript **
- External Movie API (e.g., OMDb or TMDB)



## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User types a movie title into the search field.
2. A request is sent to the movie API.
3. The API returns movie results.
4. I dynamically generate movie cards using JavaScript.
5. Users can save movies to their personal library.

The entire process is dynamic and happens without reloading the page.



## 💡 What I Learned

### Handling Large Data Sets

Rendering multiple movie cards taught me how to loop through arrays efficiently.

### Working With API Limits

I learned to handle empty results and API errors gracefully.

### UI Structure

Displaying many items at once forced me to think more carefully about layout and responsiveness.



## 😅 Challenges I Faced

- Handling cases where movies had missing posters
- Managing duplicate saves in the library
- Ensuring smooth search performance



## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add genre filtering
- Add pagination
- Add movie trailers
- Implement backend storage instead of local storage



## 🏆 Why This Project Matters to Me

This project strengthened my API handling skills and helped me think more like an application developer rather than just a layout designer.
